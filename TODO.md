- workflows / perspectives idea:
	a) select windows, and then select destination space where they'll end up
	b) select destination space, and then click on windows to move them there

- rename to `wm-workspace-groups`, or just `workspace-groups`, or maybe `workspace-group-manager`. or just `workspaces`?

- keep a list of running apps as part of the workspace config
  - so that can diff between different configs, launch/kill apps when selecting a different config, etc
